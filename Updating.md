Updating an existing CM10 install is similar to a fresh [Installation](Installation.md), except you generally do not have to wipe the data/cache partitions nor reinstall CWM (if you haven't replaced it).

Should a newer version of CWM be required, it will be explicitly mentioned in the [Changelog](Changelog.md).

**Caution:** Any update will fully wipe `/system`, be sure to reinstall Google Apps after upgrading.
